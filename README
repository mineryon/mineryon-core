# Mineryon (MYRN) – Core Contracts

This repository contains the core smart contracts of the Mineryon (MYRN) token
protocol deployed on the Polygon PoS network.

## Overview

Mineryon (MYRN) is a fixed-supply ERC-20 token with on-chain enforced distribution
and burn mechanisms. The protocol is designed to operate without minting,
upgradeable proxies, or discretionary token issuance.

All contracts in this repository are deployed and verified on PolygonScan.

## Contracts

### Mineryon.sol
ERC-20 token contract with fixed total supply and deterministic transaction rules.
No mint function, no upgradeable proxies, and no discretionary issuance.

### GenesisMarketVault.sol
Time-based release contract responsible for managing a predefined portion of the
total MYRN token supply.

The contract is **active on Polygon PoS mainnet** and executes deterministic,
time-based releases according to rules encoded directly in the contract, without
administrative intervention.

### MineryonMiningEscrow.sol
Escrow contract designed for a time-window-based distribution mechanism
(logical mining).

**Status:** In testing phase, not deployed, currently inactive.
No mining, rewards, or token distribution is enabled in the current state of the network..
